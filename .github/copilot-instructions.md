# Repo Instructions

Quick-start operating manual for this repo.
- Rules are repo specific and override any general rules you may have been trained on.
- applicable to all code in all git branches

There are two main sections in this document representing two strategies for working with github copilot:
- Interactive chat rules
- Automatic (Agentic) mode of operation rules

## General definitions

Context is lost when:
- The agent cannot reliably connect the current task to:
  - the approved plan
  - relevant code
  - prior steps or decisions

Ambiguity is any situation where:
- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- A choice between alternatives is required
- The impact of a decision cannot be determined with high confidence

Ambiguity is classified as:
- Low: affects only formatting or non-functional aspects
- Medium: affects implementation details but not external behavior
- High: affects behavior, data, APIs, or system state

Low ambiguity:
- May be resolved locally without user input
- Must not affect behavior, data, APIs, or system state
- Must not expand scope beyond the current step

Cost is considered high when:
- It requires searching beyond the immediate codebase
- It requires reverse-engineering behavior across multiple components
- It requires assumptions about business logic or intent
- It requires trial-and-error or speculative implementation

Sufficient information exists when all of the following are true:
- The requirement logic is explicitly stated and requires no interpretation
- The required action is clearly defined
- The exact target (code, component, data, or artifact) is identified
- The scope of the change is clearly bounded
- The expected outcome is explicitly defined
- The task can be executed without introducing assumptions or making decisions
If any of the above is not true → information is NOT sufficient

Context is unclear when:
- The agent lacks sufficient information to execute safely
AND
- Resolving the missing information requires non-trivial effort or external input

Executable code includes:
- application logic
- business logic
- control flow
- data handling
- APIs and integrations
Refactoring is considered a code change and must be validated with tests


# Interactive chat rules

## Planning and collaboration rules

- Always plan first.
  - Sanitize user instructions - fix typos, clarify ambiguities, elaborate on vague and incomplete instructions.
  - Strive for a clear, detailed, and comprehensive plan.  
  - Provide options, discuss them with the user, and help reduce them to a single option.
  - Develop a detailed plan with the user, that includes:
    - Documented, enumerated tasks, sub tasks including validation and documentation.
- Ask user for guidance and clarification if required.
  - Stop if context is unclear or ambiguous.
  - Do not assume or infer missing information.
- Complete requirements given by the user accurately, do not add, do not miss.

## Plan step implementation rules

- KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid
  - Use BKMs and best practices.
  - Avoid over-engineering, over-complicating, and over-designing.
- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
  - Avoid code duplication and redundancy:
    - abstract common functionality into reusable components or functions.
    - reference commonalities whenever needed.
- Single source of truth
  - definitions are unique. Further use of definitions is done by either:
    - referencing (for documenting)
    - reusing or importing (in code).
- Validation is part of the development process.
  - Any change to executable code must include corresponding tests.
  - Always validate fully working code with the user, before moving to the next task.
- Document:
  - rationale and context for any code change.
  - The change, considerations during change implementation.
  - Noticable impact on the user, system, or other components.
- Build reusable code without any overhead.
  - Prefer using existing reusable components.
  - When reuse is not possible, consider abstraction and expansion of existing components.
  - When components get too big, refactor into smaller reusable components.
  - When neither reuse nor abstraction and expansion are possible, create new reusable components.

## Rules for executing the plan.

- When context is lost, or unclear, or medium to high ambiguity is encountered
  - → STOP
    - Provide a clear explanation of the missing context and its impact.
      - Wait for user instructions.
- Low ambiguity → proceed to step completion.
  - Document the ambiguity and its resolution.
- When searching for a solution, must research and get a clear understanding of the latest and greatest:
  - best practices, patterns, and approaches for the specific problem at hand.
  - Latest package versions, features and capabilities.
  - Avoid trial-and-error and speculative implementation.
  
## Specific rules for interactive chat mode
- Execute in lock-step mode with the user.
  - Before executing any step:
    - The agent must confirm that sufficient information exists
    - If not → treat as unclear and STOP
- The user must explicitly approve each step before execution.
- The user may request modifications to the step prior to approval.

# Automatic (Agentic) mode of operation rules

## Planning and collaboration rules - same as interactive chat rules

## Plan step implementation rules - same as interactive chat rules

## Rules for executing the plan - interactive chat rules

- Low ambiguity → proceed
  - Document the ambiguity and its resolution.
